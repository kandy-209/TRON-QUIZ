## Installation
To play you will need 25Cents and 1989 TRON ENCOM arcade game.... Just kidding download my file open in browser and be DEREZED IF YOU ANSWER WRONG.

## Usage
This application is a TRON quiz game. When the user presses start to begin the quiz doesnt work, four answers should appear on buttons but I cant get them to work. Each time the user clicks a button, the next questions should appear along with four new answers.The user may click restart to begin the quiz again(but that doesnt work yet). Will need to work on this during my free time so that a user can actually play a game.
